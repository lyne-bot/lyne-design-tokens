## Usage

Have a look at the dist folder inside node_modules: `./node_modules/lyne-design-tokens/dist/`. There you will find the different variables files which you can import and use in your project.

## Development

### Conventional Commits

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to make sure we can automatically determine the next release version if necessary.

### Env Variables

To test and develop the workflow on your local machine, you need to setup an `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

```bash
TRAVIS_TOKEN=XXX
```

Replace `XXX` with the according value.

## Deployment

TravisCI is building as soon as a branch gets merged into the master branch. After successful linting, the Lyne Design Tokens package will be published to npm. You can find the package on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lyne-design-tokens).

After successful build, the job for lyne-components will be triggered.
